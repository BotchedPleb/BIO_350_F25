# BIO_350_F25
Starting our BIO350 assignment repo.
Quantitative Methods: Conservation

IC Assignment 1: Chapter 1 of Ecology Handbook
- Making a difference equation
- Tech difficulties
- Now everything works (hopefully)

IC Assignments 2: Chapter 2 of Ecology Handbook
- Making an exponential equation to measure how quickly duckweed covers a pond
- Minimal tech difficulties
- Works and introduced matplotlib

IC In Class Example 1
- Used the function from IC Assignment 2
- Log the function and graphed it
- Used if statements within a for loop to simulate population growth
- Graphed the duckweed population

IC Assignment 3: Chapter 3 of Ecology Handbook
- Created a a Logistic  Model
- Ran into some tech difficulties with kernal 
- Applied death rate into the new logistical equation
- Created plots for both logistic models

IC In Class Example 2
- Imported the first set of data with pandas
- ran plot models with the help of copilot

IC Assignement 4: Chapter 4 of Ecology Handbook
- Lotka-Volterra competition equation 
- Created an algorthim to calculate the population growth of two plant population
- Graphed using matplotlib to see the comparison betweeen the two populations
- Answered questions regarding M populution

IC In Class Example 3
- Used a modified Lotka-Volterra competition equation
- Add an if statment within the for loop
- Modified the function to reflect the new equation
- Graph the various changes within the equation

IC Assignment 5: Chapter 5 of Ecology Handbook
- SIR (Susceptable, Infected, Recovered) Models
- Created a simulation for a Fox population being infected with Rabies
- Used a function with a for loop 
- Graph the simulation with all three values of SIR

IC In Class Example 4
- Imported an R file
- Translated the initial chunck of R code into Python code
- What got translated was a function and its graph
- Successfully converted R code into Python code

IC Assignment 6: Chapter 11 & 12 of Ecology Handbook
- Learned about matrices by using numpy
- Applied an age structure growth model
- Created an algorthim and plotted the results

IC In Class Example 5
- Modeled Stage-Structure population
- Used a 3 stage approach
- Used ChatGPT to created various "real-world" examples 
- Mini reflection
