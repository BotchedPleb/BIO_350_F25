## Final Project Paper

 The following link https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26452-z provides the paper that analysize SARS-CoV-2 infection through mixture modelling. They used the language R to model their Bayesian analysis. They also used a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate any remain parameters after fixing the variance to fit their model. In terms what their data looks like it is separated in 9 different datasets and used a markdown file to write their code in. If only there were a data dictionary and ample commentary in their code to explain what everything does. From their code it appears that they were formating their data tables to best suit their needs to create their figures and tables. Idealy, if I were to create a model, my input data would require or convert it into quantitative data to run a bayesian algorithm. Thus, creating a model that can predict SARS-CoV-2 data which can provid an accurate diagnoses. 
 
 Although, in class went over bayes's theorem, I chose to run my model in a different manner. The question I want to be answered is how well a model can predict whether someone has COVID based on their various spiked protein levels. The inputs I would be using are the spikeod, spike_negod, spikeratio, spikepos in order to created a model. The output would be a model that provides insight of how well the machine model can predict with the inputs it recieves. Thus, the machine learning method I would be using from SciKit learn package would be a confusion matrix with the support of the accuracy of a random forest classifer and logistical regression. 

By Using both Logistic Regression and Random Forest provides a fuller view of model behavior. Logistic Regression provide a clear relationships between spike protein levels and infection status, showing how each feature shifts the prediction. Random Forest adds strength by capturing non-linear patterns that simple models miss. It handles the complex interactions to still produces stable predictions. Together, these methods balance clarity with accuracy and help confirm that the results hold across different modeling strategies.
