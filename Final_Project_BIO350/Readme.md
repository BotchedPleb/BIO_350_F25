 The following link https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-26452-z provides the paper that analysize SARS-CoV-2 infection through mixture modelling. They used the language R to model their Bayesian analysis. They also used a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm to estimate any remain parameters after fixing the variance to fit their model. In terms what their data looks like it is separated in 9 different datasets and used a markdown file to write their code in. If only there were a data dictionary and ample commentary in their code to explain what everything does. From their code it appears that they were formating their data tables to best suit their needs to create their figures and tables. If I were to create a model, my input data would require or convert it into quantitative data to run a bayesian algorithm. Thus, creating a model to display what the algorithm outputs.

The data I will be using has already been clean and I would verify that in my test run of the dataset. The data that has been collect revolves around spike protein levels that result from contracting COVID-19 in males and female around various parts of Kenya. The inputs I would be using are the spikeod, spike_negod, spikeratio, spikepos in order to created a model. The output would be a model that provides insight of how well the machine model can predict with the inputs it recieves. The question I want to be answered is how well a model can predict whether someone has COVID based on their various spiked protein levels.The machine learning method I would be using from SciKit learn package would be a confusion matrix with the support of the accuracy of a random forrest classifer and logistical regression.
